# JavaScript Loose Typing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error caused by its loose typing system.  The `myFunction` adds a number and a string, resulting in string concatenation rather than the expected numerical addition.  The solution showcases how to explicitly type check or convert inputs to ensure the desired arithmetic operation.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code that performs unintended string concatenation.
